			<p>  I am Anh Tran, a graduate student at the University of Utah, where I am currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science with a focus on Medical Image Analysis.<</p>
			<p>  Research Interests: <br>
			<ul>
  				<li>Computer Vision: I am more specifically interested in medical image analysis, creating 3D models from medical images. </li>
  				<li>Machine Learning: Designing machine learning model to help doctors diagnose patients.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p> Current Research Project:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Tendon's Injury in Professional Athletes:Professional runners could suffer from minor injuries or calcification in their tendons under 
					intense training regime. These could lead to major accidents if not diagnosed early, preventing them from being able to compete 
					in the future or for the rest of their career. Thus, professional athletes will annually check for these injuries. 
					It is a tedious job for doctors to go through hundreds, maybe even thousands of ultrasound to look for these injuries. 
					We want to expedite the process for doctors so they could focus on more important issues. 
				<br>
					As  the  injuries  could  be  anywhere  in  the  tendon,    traditional  methods  of extracting  features  would  be  hard  to  use,    
					where  deep  learning  would  be  the  right solution. Beside, this is a classic classification problem in which our current goal is 
					to assess whether injury occurs. A neural network architecture based on Convolution layers such ResNets or EfficientNets 
					might be a perfect match, given it is a computer vision problem,.
